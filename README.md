# BRW_ANT_CLASS
This is a basic radio wave propagation (BRW) and antenna theory (ANT) course.

I currently teach this at the Tampa Hackerspace. Please feel free to share and use my materials for educational purposes.

If there are any issues or concerns with the materials, please let me know.

Thanks and enjoy learning!
